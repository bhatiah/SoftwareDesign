The Basic Spelling Vocabulary List

By: Steven Graham, Karen R. Harris, Connie Loynachan

This list was created to help teachers know which spelling words should be taught to kids in grades 1–5. The list contains 850 words that account for 80 percent of the words children use in their writing — the ones they need to be able to spell correctly.

Comment

This list was devised to help educators know which spelling words should be taught to children. The list contains 850 words that account for 80 percent of the words children use in their writing; the ones they need to be able to spell correctly.

Mastering this relatively small corpus of words yields a high rate of return. For example, the most common 1,000 words are used 13 times more frequently than the next most common 1,000 words. It also provides teachers flexibility in planning spelling instruction, providing an opportunity to give children the "basics" while supplementing with other spelling words germane to classroom activities.

Grade level for each word was determined based upon difficulty, pattern of occurrence in children's writing across grades, and grade placement on current vocabulary lists and spelling materials. Words that children have difficulty spelling correctly are marked with an asterisk.

'Words that children have difficulty spelling correctly are marked with an asterisk.' It says it in the blurb at the top . . . .

Why is "no" harder to spell 4 kids than "yes" or "ride" or "stop" (Grade 1)? I sniff a conspiracy :P I'm not teaching my kids any of the concepts >without< the asterisks, until they're older. I want my kids to be leaders, not followers!

The words are working well for my grandson. I hope you aren't teaching your kids as leaders that numbers are letters. Just sayin...

Now take these words and enter them into the online spelling test games @ spellingcity.com it uses your lists 50 words at a time to make fantastic games and quizes that my short attention span boy of 11 loves . Now after you have drilled on a few multiplication tables until they are somewhat confident go to multiplication.com and play action games that are excellent for fast recall games ,what a breakthrough for tough learners

when you get these words go to spellingcity.com they have fantastic drill games and quizzes .You enter your own words and play fantastic entertaining reinforcement drills. My 11 year old loves them ,he learned all these words in 3 days. Now if you have multiplication trouble ,take a few tables and get a start on them ,then go to multiplication.com more fantastic high speed games . Tables learned in days. Miracles for distracted kids

Are there some words missing from the Fifth Grade list? The list jumps from I (interest) to P (piece). I suspect there should be at least a few words in between.

I am amazed on the actual spelling of the parent that comment on this page. I would recommend you interact with your children when teaching them these words. My next book “I know more than you” will do just that.
